Learning how to code is hard. But if you choose the wrong path for you, it could be even worse. So let's take a look at what those are and what the pros and cons are so YOU can make a smart decision.

## Path 1: Get a Degree

To be a web developer, you don't, and let me repeat, you don't NEED any degree. Well, formal education is not bad at all, but in tech, a lot of stuff that you don't need is being taught on the basis of broadness instead of depth. So there is value there; the only caveat is that today, companies value depth in knowledge more than broad knowledge. In the last 20 years, the marketplace has opted for specializing, and not only in the tech industry. That's why a college degree, where you will get just "a solid base," is not enough to get you a job just because.

### Pros:

* Looks good on the resume (especially if you went to an Ivy League University, MIT, Harvard, etc.)
    
* More rounded education
    
* Solid understanding of foundational concepts
    
* You can expand beyond a single branch, not just web development
    
* Live the college life (if you do on-site)
    
* Make friends and connections with peers and teachers (very valuable for future projects or job opportunities)
    
* Career services are often a lot better, research opportunities, internships, etc., that other alternatives don't offer
    

### Cons:

* Expensive, very‚Ä¶
    
* Time commitment
    
* Long and rigid structure (that's what she said ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)
    
* Focus on being broad, not on depth
    
* Worthless classes or outdated curriculum
    
* Heavy on math, which you don't really need a lot for web development
    

### I still recommend going to college if:

* You are young and want to experience college life, on-site, no remote BS; (you're young and want to have fun and be around your peers and make connections, YOLO and YOYO, I don't see anything wrong with that)
    
* It's debt-free (don't get in debt for something you can learn for free, especially this kind of money)
    
* It's an Ivy League University (these universities do make a difference in your resume, so if you can get into one of those, don't overthink, the workplace treats those with more respect, and you will definitely get an interview just by listing it on your resume)
    

Otherwise, I'll go a different route, just because of the time caveat. Four years to get a degree where you can go another route and start getting experience and being paid way sooner sounds like a better alternative for me.

## Path 2: Bootcamp

Bootcamps are great; they are a condensed way to learn and acquire skills in a fast-paced environment. The downside is that, unfortunately, it's not for everybody. They are usually expensive, ranging from 7k to 17k, and insanely fast-paced. The good thing is that they dive into specifics and don't go around the bushes when it comes to content and specialization.

### Pros:

* Good for teaching a skill set that's genuinely useful on the job
    
* Get good fast (based on how quickly you can learn)
    
* Networking, could be mentors, could be new mates you made in the bootcamp; in any case, you can leverage that you're not learning in isolation
    
* Mentorship and support from real professionals in the industry
    

### Cons:

* Expensive
    
* Fast-paced (some of them may be too fast)
    
* They don't guarantee a job
    
* Certificates of completion don't mean anything
    
* Quality varies among them
    

### I'll recommend bootcamps if:

* You have money to spend
    
* It's on-site; take a holiday and do it right, remote bootcamps have lower completion rates than on-site, and it's good to know and share with fellow coders and network
    
* They have a good career services program that can help you with your soft skills after you've got the technical part, so you can receive an offer as soon as possible
    
* It has a good track record and longevity in the industry, because they will have the best mentors and the best quality of curriculum and personnel.

## Path 3: Self-Taught

My personal favorite, self-taught is‚Ä¶ well, self-explanatory. You get yourself a few resources you like and get your hands dirty.

### Pros:

* Cheap
    
* At your own pace
    
* Since you're not following a rigid track, you can learn from different sources and get the most updated information, or maybe expand on topics you find more interesting
    

### Cons:

* Difficult to stay focused and motivated
    
* You're missing out on networking opportunities, which is a big one
    
* Lack of guidance or mentoring
    
* Some employers might not like that you don't have a traditional background, so you might need to prove yourself in their eyes to get your first job
    

### I'll recommend self-taught if:

* You can't leave work to focus on learning to code
    
* You want to learn to code as cheaply as possible
    
* You already know your way around computers and know how to find good resources online
    
* You are disciplined and consistent, which is a big one
    
* You're not afraid to ask strangers for help

### And that's a wrap! I hope you find this helpful. Keep calm and code away!
